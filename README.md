Simple helper script to record the last modified timestamp of files in a Git directory
When you push to github, it updates your contributions timestamp. 
I would like to work with the Github api to access a user's last contribtion timestamp 
and implement a proper notification system that notifies users when they are nearly ending a contribution streak.
